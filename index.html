	<br><br>
		I still not sure what I want to be when I grow up, so if you have a cool opportunity, please let me know!

	<h1>
		I make things from many different substrates.
	</h1>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Cells and DNA</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			I'm a fifth-year <a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/">Molecular Engineering</a> PhD student in 
			<a href="https://www.seeliglab.org/">the Seelig Lab</a> at the University of Washington.
			I'm working to engineer synthetic CRISPR-based gene circuits in mammalian cells.
			My research interests lie in biocomputing and using weird endogenous biological systems to make cool stuff.
		<br><br>
			I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and an MS in Biology from UC San Diego, where
			I  worked in the <a href="https://biodynamics.ucsd.edu/">the Hasty Lab</a>.
			Here, I built <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00184">a toolkit of inducible promoters for budding yeast</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Code</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			I like building web apps, weird tools, and games. I'm very comfortable with Python (Flask) and JavaScript for web development.
			I have a decent amount of experience with web development and cloud deployment technologies 
			(Docker, AWS, DigitalOcean, MongoDB, nginx, etc), but I never have fun using them.
			I'm also comfortable with Python, R, and MatLab for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
		<br><br>
			<a href="https://easygenedb.net">Easy Gene DB</a> is a custom gene database that I built from scratch 
			and manually deployed on because every other gene database had too many features, 
			and it was hard to find the things I really needed (transcripts and CDSs).
		<br><br>
			<a href="https://wiki-wall-street.com/"">Wiki Wall Street</a> is the stock market game 
			for Wikipedia articles, where you play by buying and selling articles based on their page views.
		<br><br>
			<a href="https://twitter.com/quoctran98/status/1615083930901975041?s=20">BeTeal</a> is a
			Python tool to reorganize your BeReal recap from the least teal to most teal frames, although
			I don't think anyone other than me even uses BeReal anymore...
		<br><br>
			More code projects on my <a href="https://github.com/quoctran98">GitHub</a>!
		</p>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Plastic and Wires</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			I make machines.
			Software-wise I'm proficient with Fusion360 for 3D printing, KiCAD for PCB design,
			and C++ for Arduino programming.
		<br><br>
			<a href="/images/projects/milk-machine.jpeg">A machine that mixes skim milk and heavy cream</a> 
			to make milks and creams of varying fat content. It consists of a 
			couple of relay-controlled peristaltic pumps and an Arduino in a 3D printed shell.
		<br><br>
			<a href="/images/projects/long-thumbs.png">A machine to let you reach the top of your phone screen</a> 
			without using both hands. It's just a stepper motor in a weird 3D printed phone case.
		<br><br>
			<a href="/images/projects/jello-machine.jpeg">A machine that lets you know when your jello is set</a>.
			I hypothesized that jello's electrical resistance increases as it sets. I was right.
			<br><br>
			More machines also on my <a href="https://github.com/quoctran98">GitHub</a>!
		</p>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Foods</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			Cooking normally is fun, but making things like <a href="/images/projects/tomato-soup-ice-cream.jpeg">tomato soup ice cream on a grilled cheese waffle cone</a>,
			<a href="/images/projects/potato-milkshake.jpeg">milkless room-temperature stable milkshakes made with potatoes</a>, 
			and <a href="/images/projects/mini-pies.jpeg">a meal where each dish is encased in mini pies</a> is even more fun.
		</p>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Words</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			I mainly write creative non-fiction. I have a blog called <a href="https://quocthoughts.wordpress.com/">Quoc Thoughts</a>, 
			where I write "investigative" pieces and essays about inane and unimportant things, like 
			<a href="https://quocthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/08/05/a-directory-of-daves/">the Dave Directory</a> and
			<a href="https://quocthoughts.wordpress.com/2021/06/29/why-is-the-right-faucet-handle-always-for-cold-water-part-2/">plumbing codes</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 style="margin-left: 1em">Wood</h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 3em">
			Over the summer, I got into woodworking outside of my apartment.
			I built a <a href="/images/projects/shelf.jpeg">shelf/cabinet</a>.
		</p>

	<h1>
		Sometimes I don't make things.
	</h1>
	<p style="margin-left: 3em">
		I love to read. Mainly, I read contemporary/literary fiction, sci-fi, and fantasy, but I'll read anything!
		(<a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/quoc/">StoryGraph</a> | <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69799881-quoc-tran/">Goodreads</a>)
	<br><br>
		I play a lot of board games. I'm a fan of big, thematic games with area control and/or negotiation, 
		but I also love small, weird games with unique mechanics (so sort of any game...).
		(<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/quocquocquoc">BoardGameGeek</a>)
	<br><br>
		I hosted the <a href="/images/projects/">Quoc Dines at Casual Chain Restaurants: Seattle Area Tour</a>, where I went to places like
		Applebees, Olive Garden, and the Cheesecake Factory for the first time.
	<br><br>
		I follow Formula 1 and I also sim race (I'm very bad).
	<br><br>
		I've also been trying to learn to ski.
