		I do a lot of things:
	</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			I'm a <a href="https://www.moles.washington.edu/">Molecular Engineering</a> PhD student in 
			<a href="https://www.seeliglab.org/"">the Seelig Lab</a> at the University of Washington.
			I'm working to engineer synthetic CRISPR-based gene circuits in mammalian cells.
		</li>

		<li>
			I was previously worked in the <a href="https://biodynamics.ucsd.edu/">the Hasty Lab</a> UC San Diego.
			I built a toolkit of inducible promoters in budding yeast.
		</li>

		<li>
			I write a a blog called <a href="https://quocthoughts.com/">Quoc Thoughts</a>, where I write
			"investigative" pieces and essays about inane and unimportant things, like 
			<a href="https://quocthoughts.com/2020/08/05/a-directory-of-daves/">the Dave Directory</a> and
			<a href="https://quocthoughts.com/2021/06/29/why-is-the-right-faucet-handle-always-for-cold-water-part-2/">plumbing codes</a>.
		</li>

		<li>
			I've invented foods, like <a href="/images/projects/tomato-soup-ice-cream.jpeg">tomato soup ice cream on a grilled cheese waffle cone</a>,
			a <a href="/images/projects/potato-milkshake.jpeg">milkless room-temperature stable milkhake made with potatoes</a>, 
			and a <a href="/images/projects/mini-pies.jpeg"><a href="">meal where each dish is encased in mini pies</a>.
		</li>

		<li>
			I built <a href="https://wiki-wall-street.com/""> Wiki Wall Street </a>.
			It's the stock market game for Wikipedia articles -- 
			you play by buying and selling articles based on their page views.
		</li>

		<li>
			I made <a href="http://realpokerhands.com/">a guide of REAL Texas Hold'em hands</a>
			that I use to play poker.
		</li>

		<li>
			I made <a href="https://twitter.com/quoctran98/status/1615083930901975041?s=20">BeTeal</a>,
			a Python app to reorganize your BeReal recap from the least teal to most teal frames.
		</li>

		<li>
			I built <a href="https://twitter.com/quoctran98/status/1429650270875648003?s=20">a milk machine</a>
			that mixes skim milk and heavy cream to make milk of varying fat content.
